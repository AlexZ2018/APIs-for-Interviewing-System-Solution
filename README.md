# APIs-for-Interviewing-System-Solution
capstone project

A few things you need to be careful:
1. Some packages, json, mysql-connector, jdbc, javax.mail need to be imported.
2. In invitation sending part, you need to fill in an email address and password as the sender( I have tried to implement without inputting password but failed, think that is necessary)
3. You can read the design doc in confluence page if you are confused about any implementation.
4. Feel free to contact me via yuzhang@utexas.edu.
